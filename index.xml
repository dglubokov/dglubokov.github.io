      <description>This is not my first attempt to start a blog / channel in which I would write something (for example this telegram chanel).

If we talk about what the bliki consists of, then this is of course the feed itself, sorted by date of writing + a separate wiki page that contains a collection of various best or state-of-the-art practices (like ailev).</description>
