      <description>In the Bliki section you can see the sequence of links. What is it and why? As I said, I use Bliki ideas (blog + wiki) (https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html) in order to capture any knowledge, ideas and considerations in the usual Wikipedia format, but this capture will not be instantaneous, but gradual. I will gradually fill out my personal Wikipedia as I study any issue, and also modify if any new improved methods / approaches appear.</description>

      <title>Universals, Masks and Lists</title>

      <description>I will use terms such as universals, lists, and masks very often. The author of such a triad, as I understand it now, is Roman Mikhailov.
Universals are something that cannot be defined in any way, no matter how hard you strive, it is something that cannot be described. These can be various concepts, for example: metaphysics, being, etc.</description>

      <description>This is not my first attempt to start a blog / channel in which I would write something (for example this telegram chanel). This time I approached everything in a more organized manner and I think that in the near and long time I will fix my thoughts / ideas / notes.</description>
